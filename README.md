About Developers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arif Ashogbon: I am a third-year student, currently undergoing a computer science
degree with a business minor at Wilfrid Laurier University. My love for coding and
dream of becoming a software engineer stemmed from my internal drive to solve complex
problems. Ever since I was a child, I have loved math and essentially anything that
could push me to grow mentally and develop my ingenuity, and it was this realization 
that led me to pursue a degree in computer science. I have been self-determined and 
have continuously pushed myself to refine my skills and excel in this field, which
is why I enjoy taking in projects such as this that give me the opportunity to hone
my skills and become a better developer.Website link: https://arifportfolio.com/

Zeeshan jafri: I am a fourth year computer science student at Wilfrid Laurier University. 
I entered this field so I could have a deep technical understanding of computer software
and its applications. This will enable me to be able to craft innovative solutions for the 
problems of tomorrow. My dream is to be an entrepreneur in the tech industry, to start a 
company that creates some industry disruption. In the past I have worked as an automation 
developer, and am starting a DevOps internship at TD this summer.
